FRA3 Network Outage (IPv4)

---

Our network prefix 185.26.156.0/24 at site FRA3 is completely unavailable at the moment.

The issue seems to be located at our peering provider. We have informed their team and collaborate to fix the problem.

Update: The network is available now and all services are reachable again. IPv6 connectivit had not been affected.
