*Update 2019-01-29 14:40:00*: The host is up and running again. All binaries that we provide are cleaned up now. But we have stopped all users services. Users should inspect their services before deciding, if they want to re-enabled them.

*Update 2019-01-29 12:40:00*: To avoid running any compromised binaries, we are currently cleaning up the host offline with files from a clean reference system.

*Update 2019-01-28 21:30:00*: As far as we are aware, vela is compromised. We have secured all data and decided not to put the server into production again at this moment. Further information will follow tomorrow, we will inform all affected customers by e-mail and publish further information as soon as possible. 

*Investigating 2019-01-28 17:33:00*: vela is currently down. We're investigating problems on this host.
