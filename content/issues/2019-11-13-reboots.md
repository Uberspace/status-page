## Various issues after reboots

After installing updates that required a reboot, we have rebooted all U7 hosts. While this is only a matter of minutes normally,
on some hosts we're facing problems with MariaDB crashing at startup or other issues.
A number of team members is working on all of these in parallel.

(The downtime doesn't refer to the effective downtime of a single host but to the start downtime of the first rebooted host and the end downtime of the last host fixed.)
